## Feedback
<p>I prefer to receive feedback: face to face</p>
<p>If you are going to correct me: privatly</p>
<p>If you are going to tell me I'm doing something wrong, phrase it this way: you did something wrong and explain me how to do it correctly</p>
<p>If you want to praise me: it doesnt matter for me</p>
<p>It is important to me that feedback is: constructive</p>
